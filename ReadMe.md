# Perverted Moth ‚Äì SLINO Design Files

This repository collects the **SLINO design files** and community discussion surrounding the experimental *Perverted Moth* sailing dinghy project.

The SLINO was a home-built International Moth concept ‚Äî a carbon and foam ‚Äúplate moth‚Äù constructed from router-cut panels and frames, assembled on an MDF jig. The project and build logs were originally shared on [Sailing Anarchy Forums](https://forums.sailinganarchy.com/threads/perverted-moth.89686/) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} and the [Perverted Moth Blog](http://perverted-moth.blogspot.com/search/label/slino).
